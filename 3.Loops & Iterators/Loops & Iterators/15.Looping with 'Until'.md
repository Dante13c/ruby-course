Loops & Iterators

### Looping with 'Until'

2 min

Good work!

```
i = 3
while i > 0 do
  print i
  i -= 1
end

j = 3
until j == 0 do
  print j
  j -= 1
end
```

In the example above, we wrote the same loop using `while` and using `until`.

**Instructions**

1. 
    
    - [ ] 1. Now rewrite your `while` loop using `until`. You still want to `print` out the numbers 1 through 50, inclusive.
