Loops & Iterators

### The .times Iterator

2 min

The `.times` method is like a super compact `for` loop: it can perform a task on each item in an object a specified number of times.

For example, if we wanted to print out `"Chunky bacon!"` ten times, we might type

```
10.times { print "Chunky bacon!" }
```

We don’t know why we would type that, but we could!

**Instructions**
    
- [x] 1. Use the `.times` operator to `print` out a string of your choice any number of times you like. Use the code in the text above as a guide if you need help.
