# The 'Until' Loop

3 min

The complement to the ``while`` loop is the ``until`` loop. Itâ€™s sort of like a backward ``while``:

```
i = 0
until i == 6
  i = i + 1
end
puts i
```

1. In the example above, we first create a variable i and set it to 0 (zero).
2. Then we execute a block of code until i is equal to 6. That block of code increments i.
3. When i is equal to 6, the block ends.
4. Finally, we print 6, the value of i, to the console.
   
**Instructions**
1. - [ ] On line 2, fill in the ``__`` blank so that the loop breaks when ``counter`` is greater than ``10``.

On line 5, increment ``counter`` like we do in the example above.
