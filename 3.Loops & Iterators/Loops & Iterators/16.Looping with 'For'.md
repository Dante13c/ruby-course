Loops & Iterators

### Looping with 'For'

1 min

In case you’re not picking up on the theme of Ruby having a gajillion ways to do any given task: let’s convert our loop yet again.

```
for k in 1..3
  print k
end

```

In the above example, we print out `123` by virtue of looping from `1` to `3` inclusive.

**Instructions**

    
- [ ] 1. Now `print` out the numbers from 1 to 50 inclusive, using a `for` loop instead of an `until` loop.
