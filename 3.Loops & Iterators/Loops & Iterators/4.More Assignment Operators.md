**Loops & Iterators**

# More Assignment Operators

2 min

We’ve been using syntax like ``counter = counter + 1``, which works, but as you’ll increasingly find with Ruby, there’s always another way.

A shortcut is to use an assignment operator. You already know one assignment operator: ``=``, which sets a variable. You can update a variable with additional assignment 
operators, however, which include ``+=``, ``-=``, ``*=``, and ``/=``. For instance, when you type

```
counter += 1
```

You’re telling Ruby: “Add 1 to counter, then assign that new value back to counter.” This provides a succinct way of updating variable values in our programs.

Some languages have the increment operators ++ and -- (which also add or subtract 1 from a value), but Ruby does not. You’ll have to make do with += and -=!

**Note**: Operators

    Preview: Docs In Ruby, a Set is a collection of unordered, non-duplicated values. They are functional like an Array but have quick lookup with Hash-storage. In order to use Sets: 1. Import the set module with require() 2. Use the Set keyword followed by brackets ([]) containing comma-separated values rb require("set") test_set = Set[1, 2]

**Instructions**

1. - [x] The loop from the first exercise is in the editor. Rewrite it using the appropriate assignment operator.
