Redacted!

### Great Work!

<1 min

Perfect! Feel free to mess around with your redactor to see what sorts of results you get. Think about the following:

- What could you do to make sure your redactor redacts a word regardless of whether itâ€™s upper case or lower case?
- How could you make your program take multiple, separate words to REDACT?
- How might you make a new redacted string and save it as a variable, rather than just printing it to the console?

- [x] **Instructions**

These are the questions. In the meantime, click Run to finish this REDACTED.
