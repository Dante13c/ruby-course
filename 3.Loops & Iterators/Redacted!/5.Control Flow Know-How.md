Redacted!

### Control Flow Know-How

5 min

Good! There were two problems with our output, though: we didn’t have spaces between our words, and our program didn’t actually replace the word we wanted to redact with the word `"REDACTED"`.

```
if var == 10
   print "Variable is 10"
else
   print "Variable is something else"
end
```

We can fix that with some `if`/`else` magic! The above example just reminds you how an `if`/`else` block works.

**Instructions**

1. 
    
   - [x] 1. Add an `if`/`else` statement inside your `.each`.
    
	    - `if` the current word equals the word to be redacted, then `print "REDACTED "` with that extra space.
	    - Otherwise (`else`), `print word + " "`.
    
	    The extra space in both cases prevents the words from running together.
