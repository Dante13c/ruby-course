What if you want more than two options, though? It’s ```elsif``` to the rescue! The ```elsif``` statement can add any number of alternatives to an ```if```/```else``` statement, like so:
```
if x < y  # Assumes x and y are defined
  puts "x is less than y!"
elsif x > y
  puts "x is greater than y!"
else
  puts "x equals y!"
end
```
