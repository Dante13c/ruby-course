# Billions of Booleans

3 min

Home stretch! Let’s go over boolean 
operators.

```
( 1 == 1 ) && ( 2 == 2 )  # true
( 1 == 2 ) || ( 2 == 2 ) # true
!( false ) # true
```


  1. With ```&&``` both comparisons on the left and right must evaluate to ```true``` for the entire statement to return ```true```. If the left side does not return ```true``` it will not bother trying the right side
 
  2. With ```||``` either the right or left side must evaluate to ```true```. If the left side evaluates to ```true```, the right side will not be tried because it has met the condition of one side being ```true```.

 
  3. With ```!``` you reverse the result. If you’re ```false``` you’re now ```true```. if you’re ```true``` you’re now ```false!``` Just think of it as opposite day!

**Instructions**

1.
      - [ ] The code in the editor indicates what value (true or false) we want each variable to have, and your job is to add an expression that evaluates to the correct value using boolean operators (&&, ||, or !).
