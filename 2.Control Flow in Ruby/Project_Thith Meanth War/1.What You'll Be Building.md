Now that we can direct our program using ```if``` / ```else``` statements, we can produce different results based on different 
user input.

#### Note
        Preview: Docs In Ruby, user input is made possible by the #gets method. During the executing of a Ruby program, when a line with the #gets method is read, the terminal is primed for input from the user. The input is returned as a string type after the #gets method is finished. rb name = gets puts "My name is #{name}!" The output would be:


In this project, we’ll combine control flow with a few new Ruby string methods to Daffy Duckify a user’s string, replacing each ```"s"``` with ```"th"```.
