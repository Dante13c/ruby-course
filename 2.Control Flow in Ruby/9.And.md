**Control Flow in Ruby**

# And

Comparators aren’t the only operators available to you in Ruby. You can also use **logical** or **boolean operators**. Ruby has three: and ```(&&)```, or ```(||)```, and not ```(!)```. Boolean operators result in boolean values: ```true``` or ```false```.

The boolean operator **and**, ```&&```, only results in ```true``` when **both** expression on either side of ```&&``` are ```true```. Here’s how ```&&``` works:

```
true && true # => true
true && false # => false
false && true # => false
false && false # => false
```

For example, ```1 < 2 && 2 < 3``` is ```true``` because it’s true that one is less than two **and** that two is less than three.
