Hashes and Symbols

### Many Paths to the Same Summit

Remember, there are always many ways of accomplishing something in Ruby. Converting [strings](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/strings) to symbols is no different!

Besides using `.to_sym`, you can also use `.intern`. This will internalize the string into a symbol and works just like `.to_sym`:

```
"hello".intern
# ==> :hello
```

When you’re looking at someone else’s code, you might see `.to_sym` or `.intern` (or both!) when converting strings to symbols.

    - [x] 1. Update your code from the last exercise to use `.intern` instead of `.to_sym`.
