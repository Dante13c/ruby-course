Hashes and Symbols

### Iterating Over Hashes

2 min

We can also iterate over [hashes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/hashes) using the `.each` method. For example, we could do

```
my_hash.each do |key, value|
  puts my_hash[key]
end
```

This will print out a list of values from `my_hash`, each on its own line.
