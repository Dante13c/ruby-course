Hashes and Symbols

### More Methods, More Solutions

3 min

Great work!

We’ve often found we only want the key or value associated with a key/value pair, and it’s kind of a pain to put both into our block and only work with one. Can we iterate over _just_ keys or _just_ values?

This is Ruby. Of course we can.

Ruby includes two hash methods, `.each_key` and `.each_value`, that do exactly what you’d expect:

```
my_hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }

my_hash.each_key { |k| print k, " " }
# ==> one two three

my_hash.each_value { |v| print v, " " }
# ==> 1 2 3
```

Let’s wrap up our study of Ruby [hashes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/hashes) and symbols by testing these methods out.
