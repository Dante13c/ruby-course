Hashes and Symbols

### The Story So Far

2 min

Recall that [hashes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/hashes) are [collections](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-ruby/lessons/ruby-data-structures/exercises/introduction-to-hashes) of key-value pairs, where a unique key is associated with some value. For example:

```
breakfast = { 
  "bacon" => "tasty",
  "eggs" => "tasty",
  "oatmeal" => "healthy",
  "OJ" => "juicy"
}
```

Remember that keys must be unique, but values can repeat. That’s why we can have more than one key share the value “tasty.”)

We can create hashes several ways, but two of the most popular are

1. **hash literal notation**:

```
new_hash = { "one" => 1 }
```

and

2. **hash constructor notation**:

```
new_hash = Hash.new
```
