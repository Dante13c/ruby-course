A Night at the Movies

### Setting Up

5 min

First things first: let’s create a hash to hold our movies and their ratings. Next, let’s prompt the user for input so we can eventually store movie/ratings pairs in our hash.

```
favorite_foods = {
  vegetable: 'broccoli'
}
puts "Do you like coding in Ruby?"
answer = gets.chomp
```

1. A hash is a way of storing data with a specifiable key, as opposed to an array where the data is only accessible using numbers (or indices). It is created using a pair of curly braces `{ }`.
2. `puts` displays a message in the console. In this example, we ask if you like coding in Ruby.
3. In order to get the [user input](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/user-input) , we have to call `.chomp` on `gets`.
    
    Preview: Docs In Ruby, user input is made possible by the #gets method. During the executing of a Ruby program, when a line with the #gets method is read, the terminal is primed for input from the user. The input is returned as a string type after the #gets method is finished. rb name = gets puts "My name is #{name}!" The output would be:
    
    

- [x] ***Instructions***
    - [x] 1. Create a hash and assign it to the variable `movies`. Put in your favorite movie as the key, with a number rating for the value.

- [x] ***Checkpoint 2***
    - [x] 2. Prompt the user for input with `puts` and save that input in a variable called `choice`.
    
	    After pressing **Run**, make sure to enter some text in the console then hit enter to test your code!
