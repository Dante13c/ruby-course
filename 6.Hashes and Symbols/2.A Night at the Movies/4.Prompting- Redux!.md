A Night at the Movies

### Prompting: Redux!

7 min

Great! Let’s build out each part of the `case`, one step at a time. We’ll start with the “add” branch.

- [x] ***Instructions***
    - [x] 1. Inside your `when "add"` block, remove the `puts "Added!"` statement.
	    
	    In its place, prompt the user for a movie title. Save the result in a new variable called `title`. (_Your code already has an example of how to do this!_)
	    
	    Next, prompt the user for the rating of the movie. Save that in a new variable called `rating`.
	    
	    Add that movie/rating pair to the `movies` hash and `puts` a message indicating the pair was added. (No need for `to_sym` or `to_i` just yet!)
