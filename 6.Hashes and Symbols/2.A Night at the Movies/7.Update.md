A Night at the Movies

### Update

6 min

Perfect! Let’s move on to the next branch of our `case` statement, which handles updating an existing movie in the hash. (This should be very similar to the work we did in the “add” branch!) We’ll do this in three steps:

- [x] ***Instructions***
    - [x] 1. Inside your `when "update"` block, remove the `puts "Updated!"` statement.
	    
	    Prompt the user for a movie title. Store it in `title`.
	    
	    `if` the `movies[title]` is `nil`, then the movie is not in the hash. Please `puts` a string telling the user of their error.
	    
	    Otherwise (`else`), we need to update the `movies` hash. Prompt the user for a new rating. Set the movie’s rating to that new value.
	    
	    Make sure to test it out!
