A Night at the Movies

### Not My Type

Perfect! Our program is really coming along.

You might have wondered how we’re going to get our movies and ratings from the user—which come in as strings—into the hash where we want our movies to be symbols and our ratings to be integers. Built-in Ruby magic to the rescue!

Ruby’s `.to_sym` method can convert a string to a symbol, and `.to_i` will convert a string to an integer.

- [x] ***Instructions***
    - [x] 1. Call `.to_sym` on your `title` and `.to_i` on your `rating` so that your movie titles are stored as symbols in the hash and the associated ratings are stored as integers.
    
	    To test your code, press **Run** then enter the commands in the terminal.
