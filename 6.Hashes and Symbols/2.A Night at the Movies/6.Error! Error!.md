A Night at the Movies

### Error! Error!

All right! We’re nearly done with the “add” part of our `case`. The final thing we’ll want to do is perform a check to see whether the movie to be added is already in the hash.

To do this, we’ll add an `if`/`else` statement.

- [x] ***Instructions***
    - [x] 1. Add an `if`/`else` statement to the add branch of your `case`. If the movie isn’t already in the hash (that is, if `movies[title.to_sym]` is `nil`), it should add the movie/rating pair; otherwise, it should `puts` that the movie already exists and not add anything to the hash. Make sure to test it!
