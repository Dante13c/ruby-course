A Night at the Movies

### Nice Work!

<1 min

Fantastic! You built a little app with only a few dozen lines of code. Impressive, isn’t it?

The four verbs your program knows—add, display, update, and delete—are universal. This acronym is better known as [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) for **c**reate, **r**ead, **u**pdate, and **d**elete (respectively). These are the actions you take when you update an entry in a database, ask a website for information, or write a blog post. Being familiar with this setup is good, because you’ll see it in everything from [API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) calls to web frameworks like [Ruby on Rails](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/ruby-on-rails).

- [x] ***Instructions***

	Feel free to play around with your program until you’ve got it running just the way you like it. (Maybe add a more specific `else` message than `"Error!"`?)

	When you’re ready, click Run to complete this project!
