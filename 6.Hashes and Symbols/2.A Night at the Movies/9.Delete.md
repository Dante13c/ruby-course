A Night at the Movies

### Delete

4 min

Almost there! Let’s handle the “delete” part of our `case` statement, which will remove whatever key the user specifies from the hash. (This will be very similar to what we did for “add” and “update.”)

Ruby makes it easy to remove a movie/rating pair from our hash: we just write `movies.delete(title.to_sym)`!

- [x] ***Instructions***
    - [x] 1. Go ahead and remove the `puts "Deleted!"` when the user types “delete”.
	    
	    Get the title from the user.
	    
	    Include an `if`/`else` statement that `puts` an error if the movie’s not in the hash; if it’s there, use `.delete` to remove it as shown above. Make sure to test it out!
