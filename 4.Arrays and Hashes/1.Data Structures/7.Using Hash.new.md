### Using Hash.new

2 min

What we just showed you was hash _literal notation_. We call it that because you literally describe what you want in the hash: you give it a name and you set it equal to one or more `key => value` pairs inside curly braces.

You can also create a hash using `Hash.new`, like so:

```
my_hash = Hash.new
```

Setting a variable equal to `Hash.new` creates a new, empty hash; it’s the same as setting the variable equal to empty curly braces (`{}`).
