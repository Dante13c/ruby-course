[variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/variables)

Preview: Docs A variable is a label that Ruby assigns to a particular object. There are four different types of variables in Ruby. Each type starts with a special character to indicate the type of variable it is. Local variables must begin with a lowercase letter or . These variables are local to the code block of the method they are declared in. ruby color = "green" person = "Shannon" There is nothing special about the word color in this line of code. Its just a variable name. You could set pizza = "green". While that variable name choice might be misleading to the human reading it, the value would still be "green".

 to represent each key/value pair.

```
restaurant_menu = {
  "noodles" => 4,
  "soup" => 3,
  "salad" => 2
}

restaurant_menu.each do |item, price|
  puts "#{item}: #{price}"
end
```

1. In the example above, we create a new hash called `restaurant_menu`.
2. Then, we loop through the `restaurant_menu` hash and assign the key to `item` and the value to `price` for each iteration.
3. Finally, we `puts` out:

```
noodles: 4
soup: 3
salad: 2
```

- [x] **Instructions**

1. 
    
   - [x] 1. Use `.each` to iterate over the `secret_identities` hash.
    
     Use `puts` to print each key-value pair, separated by a colon and a space (`:` ), to the console, just like the example above.
