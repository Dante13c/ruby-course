### (Re)Introduction to Iteration

2 min

Remember when we covered [loops and iterators](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-ruby/lessons/loops--iterators/exercises/the-while-loop)? We could use a whole bunch of different methods for looping in a program. When we loop over an array or a hash, we say that we _iterate_ over it.

We’ll be using the `.each` iterator to iterate over 

[arrays](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/arrays)

Preview: Docs Arrays store data values in a list. An array can contain any data type. Values are comma separated and enclosed in square brackets. Elements in the array start at an index of 0. This method will create an array with zero, one or two arguments. No arguments will create an empty array. A single argument will determine the size of the array. Two arguments will determine the size of the array and the second argument will populate the array with that value. ruby array1 = Array.new puts array1.length array2 = Array.new(7) puts "#{array2}"

 and 

[hashes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/hashes)
