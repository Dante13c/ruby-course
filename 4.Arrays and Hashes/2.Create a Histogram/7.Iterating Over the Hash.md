Create a Histogram

### Iterating Over the Hash

4 min

Almost there! Finally, we’ll need to iterate over the array to print out each key-value pair to the console.

```
fruit = {
  "apple" => 2,
  "banana" => 3,
  "cherry" => 5
}

fruit.each do |name, count|
  puts name + " " + count.to_s
end
```

1. In the example above, we create a hash called `fruit` that maps names of fruit to the amount that we own.
2. Then, we iterate over `.each` key/value pair, storing the key as `name` and the value as `count`.
3. Finally, we print out the key and value separated by a space. Note that we must first convert the value from a number to a string using `.to_s` before we can concatenate it.

    - [ ] 1.Iterate over `.each` key/value pair in the `frequencies` hash.
    
	    Then, `puts` each word, a single space, and its frequency to the console, like in the example above.
