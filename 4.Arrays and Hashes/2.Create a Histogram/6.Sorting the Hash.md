Create a Histogram

### Sorting the Hash

6 min

Great! We have a hash full of word / frequency key-value pairs. Now we need to figure out a way to get our information in the order we want it.

```
colors = { 
  "blue" => 3,
  "green" => 1,
  "red" => 2
}
colors = colors.sort_by do |color, count|
  count
end
colors.reverse!

```

1. In the example above, we first create a hash called `colors` that maps color

     to numbers.
2. Then, we sort `colors` into green, red, and blue, from smallest to largest by count. Just so you know, the `.sort_by` function returns an array of

    , but that’s fine for our purposes.
3. Finally, we reverse the array order so that the colors with the largest counts are first.

Can you do the same thing with the `frequencies` hash?

1. 
    
    - [x] 1. Use `.sort_by` to sort the `frequencies` hash by word count, like step 2 above. Store the result back in `frequencies`.
    
	    Use `.reverse!` to reverse the sorted `frequencies` array.
