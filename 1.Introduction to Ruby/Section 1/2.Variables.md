# Variables

1 min

One of the most basic concepts in computer programming is the variable. You can think of a variable as a word or name that grasps a single value. For example, let’s say you needed the number 25 from our last example, but you’re not going to use it right away. You can set a variable, say my_num, to grasp the value 25 and hang onto it for later use, like this:

```
my_num = 25
```


Declaring variables in Ruby is easy: you just write out a name like my_num, use = to assign it a value, and you’re done! If you need to change a variable, no sweat: just type it again and hit = to assign it a new value.

## Self Notes

#### Variable
These acts as containers for **Data Types** which is the various different formats for storing information, you can call these variables or acces the data inside to use in other parts of your program,

*example*

```
my_name = "Apollo"
my_age = "28"

puts my_name #==> Apollo
puts my_age #==> 28
```

*```my_name```*, the first variable defined and *```my_age```* the second one defined both stored some data, which included a name in form of a string and an age in the form of a number, both variables were accessed by printing the values using the ```puts``` function.
