**Putting the Form in Formatter**

# Formatting with String Methods

6 min

Great! Now we’ve got our output, but as you can see, we haven’t used string methods to properly capitalize everything yet.

```
print "This is my question?"
answer = gets.chomp
answer2 = answer.capitalize 
answer.capitalize!
```


1. First we introduce one new method, capitalize, here. It capitalizes the first letter of a string and makes the rest of the letters lower case. We assign the result to answer2
2. The next line might look a little strange, we don’t assign the result of capitalize to a variable. Instead you might notice the ! at the end of capitalize. This modifies the value contained within the variable answer itself. The next time you use the variable answer you will get the results of answer.capitalize

**Instructions**

1.
   - [x] After each variable assignment: ```first_name```, ```last_name```, and ```city``` add the ```.capitalize!``` method

   For state use the ```.upcase!``` method
