**Introduction to Ruby**

# Math

3 min

Ruby isn’t limited to simple expressions of assignment like my_num = 100; it can also do all the math you learned about in school.

There are six arithmetic ***operators*** we’re going to focus on:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

Exponentiation (**)

Modulo (%)

The only ones that probably look weird to you are exponentiation and ***modulo***. Exponentiation raises one number (the base) to the power of the other (the exponent). For example, 2**3 is 8, since 2**3 means “give me 2 * 2 * 2“ (2 multiplied together 3 times). 3**2 is 9 (3 * 3), and so on.

Modulo returns the remainder of division. For example, 25 % 7 would be 4, since 7 goes into 25 three times with 4 left over.

## Self Notes 

**Math Operators**

the operators serves as tools used to execute mathematical operations (hence the name 'operator', which means the result could be used imediately or stored)

**Modulo** and **Exponential**

apart from the operators such as addition and subtraction...etc, we have two special operators that gives the result of difference(*Modulo*) or to rais a numbers base by its exponent counterpart(*Exponential*)
