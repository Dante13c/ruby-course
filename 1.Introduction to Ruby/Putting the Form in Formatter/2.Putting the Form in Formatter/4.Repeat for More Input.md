**Putting the Form in Formatter**
# Repeat for More Input

4 min

All right! Now we need to repeat what we’ve done for ```last_name```, ```city```, and ```state```.

**Instructions**

1.
    - [x] Add ```print``` prompts, variables, and ```gets.chomps``` for the user’s last name, city, and state/province. Use ```last_name``` as the variable for the user’s last name, ```city``` for their city, and ```state``` for their state or province. (Hint: prompt the user to provide an abbreviation for their state or province, such as “**NY**” for New York. This will naturally lead us to use ```.upcase``` later!)

After pressing **Run**, type a response in the console and hit enter for each prompt.
