Methods, Blocks, & Sorting

### Method Syntax

2 min

Methods are defined using the keyword `def` (short for “`def`ine”). Methods have three parts:

1. The _header_, which includes the `def` keyword, the name of the method, and any _arguments_ the method takes. (We’ll get to arguments in the next section)
2. The _body_, which is the code block that describes the procedures the method carries out. The body is indented two spaces by convention (as with `for`, `if`, `elsif`, and `else` statements)
3. The method ends with the `end` keyword.

Here’s an example of what the syntax would look like for a simple function, `welcome`, that just prints “Welcome to Ruby!” to the console:

```
def welcome
  puts "Welcome to Ruby!"
end

```
