### The Combined Comparison Operator

3 min

We can also use a new operator called the _combined comparison operator_ to compare two Ruby objects. The combined comparison operator looks like this: `<=>`. It returns `0` if the first _operand_ (item to be compared) equals the second, `1` if the first operand is greater than the second, and `-1` if the first operand is less than the second.

A block that is passed into the `sort` method must return either`1`, `0`, or `-1`. It should return -1 if the first block parameter should come before the second, `1` if vice versa, and `0` if they are of equal weight, meaning one does not come before the other (_i.e._ if two values are equal)
