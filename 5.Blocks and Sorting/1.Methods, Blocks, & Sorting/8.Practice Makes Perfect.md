### Practice Makes Perfect

You won’t become a Master Method Maker ‘til you make a mess of methods. (Say _that_ three times fast.)

```
def by_five?(n)
  return n % 5 == 0
end
```

The example above is just a reminder of how to define a method.

- [x] ***Instructions***
    - [x] 1. Define a method called `greeter` that takes a single string parameter, `name`, and returns a string containing that person’s name.
    
	    Make sure to `return` the string. Don’t use `print` or `puts`.
    
- [x] ***Checkpoint 2***
    - [x] 2. Define a `by_three?` method that takes a single integer parameter, `number`, and returns `true` if that number is evenly divisible by three and `false` if not.
