Methods, Blocks, & Sorting

### Blocks

2 min

Let’s go over what we learned about blocks.

```
numbers = [5, 2, 8]
sum = 0
numbers.each do |n|
  sum += n
end
puts sum
```

The example above is just a reminder about syntax. We calculate the sum of a list of numbers.

- [x] ***Instructions***
    - [x] 1. Add a block after `.each` that multiplies each item by itself and `puts` the result to the console.
