Methods, Blocks, & Sorting

### How Blocks Differ from Methods

2 min

There are some differences between blocks and methods, however.

Check out the code in the editor. The `capitalize` method capitalizes a word, and we can continually invoke the `capitalize` method by name. We can `capitalize("matz")`, `capitalize("eduardo")`, or any string we like to our hearts’ content.

However, the block that we define (following `.each`) will only be called _once_, and in the context of the array that we are iterating over. It appears just long enough to do some work for `each`, then vanishes into the night.

Make sense? Run the code to see the magical marriage of methods and blocks.
