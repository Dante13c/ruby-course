Methods, Blocks, & Sorting

### Introduction to Sorting

2 min

Sorting [arrays](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/arrays) is a very common problem in computer science, and is well studied for that reason. There are many _algorithms_ —well-defined sequences of steps—each with its own trade-offs and advantages.

Sorting algorithms can be a great introduction to computer science as a theoretical discipline, but for now we’ll focus on how to use Ruby’s built-in sorting library (which implements a few of these algorithms).

    - [ ] 1. Use the `.sort!` method to sort the values in `my_array`. Magic, isn’t it?
    
    Display `my_array` in the console.
