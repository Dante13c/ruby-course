Methods, Blocks, & Sorting

### Sorting

3 min

Finally, let’s review what we learned about sorting.

```
books.sort! do |firstBook, secondBook|
  firstBook <=> secondBook
end
```

Remember that the above example was how we sorted in alphabetical order.

- [x] ***Instructions***
    - [x] 1. Use `.sort!` to sort the `fruits` array in descending (that is, reverse) alphabetical order. You can use the combined comparison operator (like the example above) or an `if`/`elsif`/`else` statement.
