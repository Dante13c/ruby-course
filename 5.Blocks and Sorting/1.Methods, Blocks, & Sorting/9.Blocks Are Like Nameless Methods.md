Methods, Blocks, & Sorting

1 min

Most methods that you’ve worked with have defined names that either you or someone else gave them (_i.e._ [array].sort(), “string”.downcase(), and so on). You can think of blocks as a way of creating methods that don’t have a name. (These are similar to anonymous [functions](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/functions) in JavaScript or lambdas in Python.)

Blocks can be defined with either the keywords `do` and `end` or with curly braces (`{}`).
