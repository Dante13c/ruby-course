# Returning the Final String—Er, "Thtring"

2 min

Home stretch—now we want to display the Daffy Duckified string to the user. You can do that using the string interpolation we learned earlier:

```
my_string = "muchachos"
print "Adios, #{my_string}!"
# ==> "Adios, muchachos!"
```

**Instructions**

1. - [x] Add a ``puts`` statement that uses string interpolation to show the user their transformed string.
